# The Mercurial JavaScript Quiz Board


## Project Description

This project enables a user to test their knowledge of javaScript. A user will be able to take a JS quiz and get their results to confirm if their understanding of the language is above novice-level. Users first leave their names and emails then proceed to take the test.The user submits their answers where a predefined code checks their correctness and grades the take. Afterwards, users can view their results of their take via a check button. Upon their will, users can get their results emailed to them if they provided an email.


## Deployment

To deploy the program, stage it on Git and push it to GitHub. Then, create a gh-pages branch from your master branch in the local machine. Thereafter, push the project to gh-pages on GitHub. After that, the program will be ready for Deployment on Git Hub Pages

## Behavior Driven Development
  As with any other reputable development project, the Mercurial JavaScript Quiz Board followed a systematic process between its conceptualization stage and its actual implementation. First, it was considered that users needed to perform certain tasks. However, due to the simplicity of the program, there wasn't much users could do with it. However, it was assumed that in the least, users should:

  * View the posted javaScript questions
  * Choose the correct answers among the multiple choices
  * Choose multiple answers where cases allow such an option
  * View their progress inconclusively navigating the series
  * Submit their answers
  * View their results after completion

  Considering these two desired behaviors, it was evident that the program should at least:

  1. Provide suitable answering methodologies such as option boxes and check-boxes
  2. Provide a status bar to show the progress of a quiz
  3. Provide a submit button to check the answers for correctness
  4. Provide a back-end code to mark the answers and grade the users
  5. Provide a means to display the results of an attempt
  6. Provide a means to toggle the visibility of the results
